This repository is a first step to help the Couchbase community develop a standard, cross-platform (iOS, Android, and future platforms!) way of managing a CouchDB when using PhoneGap.

I started a thread explain this: https://groups.google.com/group/mobile-couchbase/browse_thread/thread/f4e9bc30e1dd3818

The goals are:
1) Allow for offline CouchApp loading since you cannot assume there will be a connection to download a CouchApp.
2) Provide a standard way for users to to authorized locally and to create an account on a remote server. 
3) Provide best practice samples for organizing and syncing local and remote databases. For example: using local databases like "appdata_db" with server databases like "myusername/appdata_db" and making sure authentication and authorization is secure.
4) Allow for users to trigger synchronizations from their mobile device while handling 2) and 3).
5) Cross-platform project creation in as simple and trouble free way as possible.

Current Progress
**************
1) Offline CouchApp loading on iOS - YES
2) Offline CouchApp loading on Android - NOT YET..volunteers? 


iOS Overview

Goal 1) Allow for offline CouchApp loading

There is an objective-C class called CouchAppManager which handles: 
- CouchApp version checking either using the _rev field (version check requires CouchApp JSON loading/parsing) or a client supplied version string (version check can be performed without CouchApp JSON loading/parsing)
- creating the CouchApp database if it doesn't exist, creating and updating the CouchApp (with the correct _rev and _id fields)
- loading of any CouchApp page URL

Sample Code:

1) See AppDelegate.h and AppDelegate.m for integration tips. All Couchbase code that is integrated into PhoneGap is labeled with:

// Couchbase changes START
// Couchbase changes END

2) See AppDelegate.m couchbaseDidStart for a sample usage with _rev field based versioning. If you want to a avoid parsing the CouchApp to determine the version (for example, for release build), just pass a version string instead of nil to loadNewAppVersion:nil.

3) The workflow to update the CouchApp is currently as follows:

  a) Load the CouchApp into a desktop/laptop/cloud CouchDB. For example: 
     couchapp autopush http://127.0.0.1:5984/mycouchapp_db

  b) When you are happy with the CouchApp, serialize it and put it in the Resources XCode project directory. For example: 
     cd phonegap-couchbase-xplatform/phonegap-couchbase-ios/phonegap-couchbase-ios/Resources
     curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/mycouchapp_db/_design/mycouchapp?attachments=true > mycouchapp.json

  c) Then build and run in XCode. 


Notes:
- doesn't use Trundle to try to keep it minimal.
- currently bundled with minimal Vendor Source (Couchbase, TouchFoundation, TouchJSON). The TouchJSON could be moved over to use a compiled library if needed.
- currently the library is written to use synchronous HTTP calls to keep the program flow simple. You can use Grand Central Dispatch to put it on a background thread.

Known issues:
- Currently the iPhone and iPad device versions don't compile cleanly. However, the simulator does. If anyone can fix this and explain how, please let me know!
